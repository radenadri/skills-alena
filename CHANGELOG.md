## [4.2.0] — 2026-03-16 — Next.js to Nuxt Migration Skill

### ✨ Added

- **New skill: `nextjs-to-nuxt-migration`** — Comprehensive 2100-line skill for porting any module from a Next.js (React) app to Nuxt 4 (Vue 3) backed by NestJS
  - Generic placeholders (`{module}`, `{Module}`, `{Model}`, `{react-repo}`, `{nuxt-repo}`, `{nestjs-repo}`) — user provides module name and repo paths once, skill substitutes everywhere
  - Phase -1 submodule analysis (5-step: understand → data flow → UI actions → backend verification → task plan)
  - Multi-pass execution: Pass 1 (backend wiring) → Pass 2 (feature completeness) → Pass 3 (CSS polish) → Pass 4 (verification)
  - JSON-to-server-side translation reference (select-all pattern, pagination, debounced search, export polling)
  - Nuxt 4 navigation patterns: `navigateTo()`, `useRouter().push()`, `<NuxtLink>` — with common mistake prevention
  - Sidebar registration protocol (`AppSidebar.vue` navMenu) for every new module page
  - Theme Configurator rules — CSS variable tokens (`bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `border-border`) and dark mode compliance
  - URL encoding for Title Case status values — Axios auto-encoding, double-encoding prevention
  - Title Case status enum standard (`'Active'`, `'In Progress'`, `'Not Started'`) across all modules
  - Backend type system reference: standard API response envelope, error response, status conventions, query param rules
  - UI Design Patterns: modal vs slideover decision, `p-6` padding rules, card gradient patterns, font color/contrast rules, loading skeleton shapes
  - Agent Team File Protocol: `.planning/{module}/RESEARCH.md`, `PLAN.md`, `EXECUTING.md`, `VERIFY.md` templates
  - Playwright visual QA: 5-step protocol with JS `evaluate()` for stretched button detection and card height mismatch detection
  - Multi-agent strategy: parallel Phase -1 analysis, sequential execution, CSS-only Pass 3 can parallelize
  - Full concept translation reference: hooks → composables, Context → Pinia, react-hook-form → composable pattern, shadcn/ui → shadcn-vue

## [4.1.1] — 2026-03-12 — Critical Hook Bugfix Release

### 🔴 Critical Fixes

- **All hooks crash in ESM projects** — Hooks used `require()` (CommonJS) but `package.json` has `"type": "module"`, causing `ReferenceError: require is not defined` in any ESM project. **Fix:** Renamed all 7 hook files from `.js` to `.cjs` to force CommonJS mode regardless of project module type
- **Security gate completely non-functional** — All regex patterns in `security-gate` were broken due to incorrect string escaping (`\(` in JS strings = `(`, not `\(`), producing `SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression` on startup. Password detection, API key scanning, eval/XSS/SQLi checks were never running. **Fix:** Rewrote all patterns using proper RegExp literals
- **Missing frontmatter on `/memory` command** — The only command without YAML frontmatter, breaking command registration and metadata extraction. **Fix:** Added standard frontmatter block

### 🟠 High Priority Fixes

- **Unsafe JSON.parse on metrics files** — Corrupted temp files in `context-monitor` and `suggest-compact` hooks could crash with unhandled exception instead of graceful exit. **Fix:** Wrapped metrics file parsing in dedicated try-catch with clean exit
- **Brittle Gemini platform detection** — All hooks used `GEMINI_API_KEY` env var presence to detect Gemini CLI, but users may have this var set while using Claude Code, causing wrong hook event names. **Fix:** Changed to explicit `GEMINI_CLI === '1'` check
- **cost-tracker creates .planning/ directory** — The hook's own comment said "Don't create .planning if it doesn't exist" but the code created it anyway, polluting projects that don't use planning. **Fix:** Now returns early if `.planning/` doesn't exist
- **CLI installer referenced `.js` hook filenames** — Updated all hardcoded hook paths and file filters in `src/cli.ts` to use `.cjs` extensions

### 📊 Stats

- **7 hooks renamed** (`.js` → `.cjs`)
- **1 hook rewritten** (security-gate regex patterns)
- **1 command fixed** (memory.md frontmatter)
- **3 hooks patched** (JSON.parse safety, platform detection, directory creation)
- **CLI installer updated** (hook path references)

- **Continuous Learning** (`/learn`) — Extract reusable patterns from sessions across 8 categories with deduplication, persisted to `.planning/LEARNINGS.md`
- **Quality Gate Pipeline** (`/quality-gate`) — 6-step quality pipeline (Build → Type Check → Lint → Test → Security → Diff) with 4 modes: quick, full, pre-commit, pre-pr
- **Hook Profile System** — Three-tier hook gating (minimal/standard/strict) via `SBA_HOOK_PROFILE` env var with per-hook profile mapping

- **Strategic Compaction Hook** (`suggest-compact.js`) — Suggests `/compact` at logical breakpoints (60%+ context usage, post-verification) with 15-call cooldown
- **Cost Tracking Hook** (`cost-tracker.js`) — Session metrics (tool calls, files, agents) logged to `.planning/cost-log.md` on session end
- **Checkpoint System** (`/checkpoint`) — Named progress snapshots with create/verify/list modes stored in `.planning/checkpoints/`

### 🧠 Skills Enhancement
- All 29 skills enhanced to **10/10 quality standard**
- Added **Anti-Shortcut Rules** to every skill — prevents common bypasses
- Added **Common Rationalizations** with rebuttals — addresses excuses for cutting corners
- Added **Iron Questions** to every skill — requires evidence-based answers
- Added **When NOT to Use** sections — clear activation boundaries
- Standardized output formats, red flags, and integration sections across all skills
- Enhanced meta-skills (`writing-skills`, `using-skills`) with comprehensive templates

### 🔧 CLI Overhaul
- **New command:** `update` / `upgrade` — updates all skills and refreshes CLAUDE.md/GEMINI.md sections
- **New command:** `status` — shows installed version, agents, and update availability
- **New flag:** `-y, --yes` — non-interactive mode for CI/CD
- **New:** `.skills-alena.json` manifest for version tracking at project root
- **Fix:** CLAUDE.md/GEMINI.md now uses `<!-- START/END -->` markers — re-installs **update** the section instead of silently skipping
- **Fix:** Only appends a **minimal activation section** with correct per-agent paths (previously appended the entire package file with wrong paths)
- **Fix:** Global installs (`-g`) correctly skip entry point files, commands, workflows, and agents
- **Fix:** Skills output now shows separate new vs updated counts
- **Fix:** Entry point file results are deduplicated when multiple agents share GEMINI.md

### 📝 Entry Point Behavior (CLAUDE.md / GEMINI.md)
- **New file:** Creates with activation section wrapped in boundary markers
- **Existing file, no markers:** Appends activation section (preserves your content)
- **Existing file, has markers:** Replaces only the marked section (your content untouched)
- **Global install:** Entry point files are never modified

### 📊 Memory / Planning
- `.planning/MEMORY.md` is **never** installed by the CLI — always created at runtime per-project by the AI agent
