# ALENA

> v1.0.0 — A personal toolkit for autonomous, networked AI agents.

## How It Works

You have a library of composable skills. Before any task, check if a relevant skill exists. Skills are not suggestions — they are mandatory workflows when their activation conditions are met.

**Check skills before:**
- Writing any code
- Debugging any issue
- Reviewing any PR
- Auditing any system
- Planning any feature
- Refactoring any module

## Core Principles

Read and internalize `rules/core-principles.md` before any work.

**The four non-negotiables:**
1. **Evidence before claims** — Never say "done" without verification
2. **Root cause before fixes** — Never patch symptoms
3. **Plan before code** — Never start coding without understanding what you're building
4. **Context before degradation** — Quality drops as context fills. Plan for it.

## Skill Activation

Skills activate automatically when their conditions are met. You MUST use the relevant skill — skipping is not an option.

## Anti-Hallucination Protocol

Read `rules/anti-hallucination.md`. Summary:

1. **Never fabricate** — If you don't know, say so
2. **Never assume** — Verify file existence, function signatures, variable names
3. **Never extrapolate** — Read the actual code, don't guess from names
4. **Never claim completion without evidence** — Run the command, read the output

## Severity Framework

All findings use the standard severity framework from `rules/severity-framework.md`:

| Level | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 🔴 | Critical | Production risk, security vulnerability, data loss potential |
| 🟠 | High | Must fix before next deploy |
| 🟡 | Medium | Technical debt, fix within sprint |
| 🟢 | Low | Improvement opportunity, backlog |
| ⚪ | Info | Observation, no action needed |

## Commands

Slash commands are available in `commands/`. Key commands:

| `/audit` | Run security, performance, architecture, or database audit |
| `/debug` | Systematic debugging with root cause analysis |

| `/progress` | Project progress dashboard |
| `/init-project` | Bootstrap `.planning/` directory |
| `/learn` | Extract patterns from current session into `.planning/LEARNINGS.md` |
| `/quality-gate` | Run build/lint/test/security pipeline (modes: quick, full, pre-commit, pre-pr) |
| `/checkpoint` | Create or verify named progress checkpoints |
| `/loop` | Repeat a task across targets with safety bounds |
| `/orchestrate` | Chain agents: feature, bugfix, refactor, security, or custom |
| `/context` | Switch mode: dev (code-first), research (read-widely), review (quality-first) |

## Agents

Specialist agents are available in `agents/` for subagent spawning:

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| `researcher` | Evidence-based code research |
| `planner` | Task decomposition and wave planning |
| `executor` | Plan implementation with verification |
| `reviewer` | Code review and quality assessment |
| `mapper` | Codebase structural mapping |
| `debugger` | Scientific hypothesis-driven debugging |
| `verifier` | Implementation verification and gap analysis |
| `investigator` | Deep-dive analysis and root cause investigation |
| `fixer` | Targeted issue resolution and patch application |

## Council Commands (Multi-Agent Teams)

The `/team` command runs a multi-agent council with real subagent spawning via `Task()`. Each agent gets fresh 200k context. State is managed deterministically by the CLI — no LLM-driven file creation.

All commands: `node planning-tools.cjs council <subcommand>`

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `council init <objective> --preset <type>` | Initialize council state machine |
| `council advance` | Move to next agent (with gate validation) |
| `council advance --force` | Move to next agent (skip gate check) |
| `council message <from> <to> <type>` | Create numbered handoff message |
| `council handoff <agent>` | Record agent completion with handoff doc |
| `council gate-check` | Validate transition quality gate |
| `council board` | Regenerate task board (BOARD.md) |
| `council status` | Show current council state as JSON |
| `council task-add <desc>` | Add task (`--assignee`, `--depends-on`) |
| `council task-update <id> --status <s>` | Update task (`pending\|in-progress\|done\|blocked`) |
| `council summary` | Generate council summary report |
| `council close` | Close council with final report |
| `council resume` | Resume a previously archived council |
| `council reset` | Archive current council and start fresh |

**Presets:** `full` (5 agents), `rapid` (3), `debug` (3), `architecture` (3), `refactoring` (4), `audit` (3)

**Quality gates** are code-enforced. Each transition requires specific handoff content (e.g., `researcher->architect` requires a `findings` section). Gates block advancement until criteria are met.

**State** lives in `.planning/council/council.json`. Handoffs in `handoffs/`, messages in `messages/`, tasks in `tasks/`.

See `docs/AGENT-TEAMS-AND-MEMORY.md` for the full architecture guide.
