## Part 1: Skills Audit (29 Skills)

### Tier Classification

Skills are rated on three dimensions:
- **Effectiveness (E):** Does following this skill produce measurably better results?
- **Authenticity (A):** Is the content genuine/practical, not just boilerplate advice?
- **Capability (C):** How deep, comprehensive, and edge-case-aware is it?

---

| `incident-response` | 177 | 8 | 8 | 8 | **8.0** | Communication templates are practical. Post-mortem template is thorough. |

**What Tier 2 needs to reach Tier 1:**
- Common Rationalizations tables (only some have these)
- Anti-Shortcut Rules (only brutal-exhaustive-audit has these)
- More real-world anti-pattern examples with code
- Deeper edge case coverage

---

### 🥉 Tier 3 — Adequate Skills (5-7/10)

Functional, follow the template, but more checklist-oriented than process-oriented. These would benefit most from enhancement.

| Skill | Lines | E | A | C | Avg | Notes |
|-------|-------|---|---|---|-----|-------|
| `writing-documentation` | 209 | 7 | 7 | 7 | **7.0** | Good templates for README, API docs, architecture docs. Lacks enforced process — more advisory. |
| `frontend-audit` | 171 | 7 | 7 | 6 | **6.7** | Covers components, state, design system. Somewhat shallow on each topic — breadth over depth. |
| `observability-audit` | 173 | 7 | 7 | 6 | **6.7** | RED method is good. Could be deeper on distributed tracing and alerting. |
| `ci-cd-audit` | 168 | 7 | 7 | 6 | **6.7** | Good pipeline stages. Rollback strategy table is practical. Lacks depth on IaC, GitOps. |
| `api-design-audit` | 188 | 7 | 7 | 6 | **6.7** | REST conventions table is solid. Pagination guidance is good. GraphQL/gRPC coverage is thin. |
| `accessibility-audit` | 164 | 7 | 7 | 6 | **6.7** | Good WCAG basics. ARIA rules section is on point. Could be deeper on screen reader testing. |
| `dependency-audit` | 151 | 7 | 7 | 6 | **6.7** | License compliance table is valuable. Necessity check is good. Supply chain depth is lacking. |

**What Tier 3 needs to improve:**
- Add Iron Questions (like full-stack-api-integration has)
- Add Common Rationalizations table
- Deepen each audit phase with more detection patterns and code examples
- Add more framework-specific guidance

---

## Part 2: Rules Audit (5 Rules)

| Rule | Size | E | A | C | Avg | Notes |
|------|------|---|---|---|-----|-------|

## Part 6: Entry Points Audit (CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md)

### CLAUDE.md — Score: 6.0/10

**Issues:**
1. 🔴 **Missing 6 skills from activation table:** `full-stack-api-integration`, `product-completeness-audit`, `brutal-exhaustive-audit`, `persistent-memory`, `agent-team-coordination`, `writing-skills` (listed in file structure but not in activation table)
2. 🟠 **File structure section is stale:** Doesn't list the newer skills
3. 🟡 **No mention of commands, agents, or cursor-rules:** Users don't know these exist
4. 🟡 **No mention of persistent memory or team coordination**

### GEMINI.md — Score: 7.0/10

**Issues:**
1. 🔴 **References non-existent path:** `.agent/skills/_rules/SKILL.md` — this directory does not exist in the project
2. 🟠 **Missing skills from activation table:** `persistent-memory`, `agent-team-coordination` not in the activation table
3. 🟡 **No file structure section** (CLAUDE.md has one, GEMINI.md doesn't)
4. ⚪ GEMINI.md does include `full-stack-api-integration`, `product-completeness-audit`, and `brutal-exhaustive-audit` that CLAUDE.md is missing

---

## Critical Findings

### 🔴 Finding 1: CLAUDE.md Activation Table is Stale
**Severity:** 🔴 Critical
**Location:** `CLAUDE.md:30-50`
**Evidence:** CLAUDE.md activation table has 20 skills. GEMINI.md has 23. The project has 29 skills total. Six skills are missing from CLAUDE.md's activation table.
**Impact:** Claude Code users won't discover or use the newer, higher-quality skills (brutal-exhaustive-audit, product-completeness-audit, full-stack-api-integration are among the best in the library).
**Recommendation:** Update CLAUDE.md activation table to match GEMINI.md's complete list, and add the remaining missing skills.

### 🔴 Finding 2: GEMINI.md References Non-Existent Path
**Severity:** 🔴 Critical
**Location:** `GEMINI.md:19,57`
**Evidence:** References `.agent/skills/_rules/SKILL.md` which does not exist. The `skills/_rules/` directory was never created.
**Impact:** Gemini/Antigravity agents are told to read a file that doesn't exist, breaking the onboarding flow.
**Recommendation:** Either create the `_rules/SKILL.md` file (containing core-principles + anti-hallucination content) OR change the reference to point to the correct location.

### 🟠 Finding 3: Commands Use Bash Syntax, Not PowerShell
**Severity:** 🟠 High
**Location:** Most commands (deep-audit, execute, verify, etc.)
**Evidence:** Commands contain `cat`, `ls`, `grep -rn`, `rm -rf`, `2>&1`, heredocs (`cat > file << 'PLAN'`). All bash-only syntax.
**Impact:** Commands will fail on Windows/PowerShell. Since the author (you) uses Windows + PowerShell, this is a significant usability gap for your own workflow.
**Recommendation:** Either: (a) document that commands are bash-oriented and intended for Claude Code (which runs in a Linux sandbox), or (b) create PowerShell-compatible variants.

### 🟠 Finding 4: Tier 3 Skills Lack Common Rationalizations
**Severity:** 🟠 High
**Location:** `frontend-audit`, `observability-audit`, `ci-cd-audit`, `api-design-audit`, `accessibility-audit`, `dependency-audit`, `writing-documentation`
**Evidence:** The flagship skills (brutal-exhaustive-audit, product-completeness-audit, full-stack-api-integration) all have "Common Rationalizations" or "Anti-Shortcut Rules" tables. The Tier 3 skills have none.
**Impact:** AI agents are more likely to cut corners on these audits because there's no explicit rationalization prevention.
**Recommendation:** Add a 5-7 row "Common Rationalizations" table to each Tier 3 skill.

### 🟠 Finding 5: `writing-skills` Meta-Skill References CLAUDE.md Only
**Severity:** 🟠 High
**Location:** `skills/writing-skills/SKILL.md:141`
**Evidence:** "New skills must be added to the `CLAUDE.md` activation table" — doesn't mention GEMINI.md.
**Impact:** New skills may only be added to CLAUDE.md, causing GEMINI.md to fall further out of sync.
**Recommendation:** Update to reference both CLAUDE.md and GEMINI.md (and any future entry points).

### 🟠 Finding 6: `using-skills` References CLAUDE.md Only
**Severity:** 🟠 High
**Location:** `skills/using-skills/SKILL.md:65`
**Evidence:** "CHECK the CLAUDE.md activation table" — doesn't mention GEMINI.md.
**Impact:** Gemini/Antigravity users are directed to wrong file.
**Recommendation:** Make agent-agnostic: "CHECK the activation table in CLAUDE.md or GEMINI.md (depending on your agent)."

### 🟠 Finding 7: No Skill Exists Yet for `.planning/` Project Initialization
**Severity:** 🟠 High
**Location:** Project-wide
**Evidence:** The `init-project` command (5,476 B) exists, but there is no corresponding `project-initialization` skill. The persistent-memory and agent-team-coordination skills reference `.planning/` but don't provide a bootstrapping skill.
**Impact:** The `.planning/` directory is critical infrastructure for memory, team coordination, and plan execution, but bootstrapping is only available via Claude Code commands.
**Recommendation:** Create a `project-initialization` skill that works across all agents.

### 🟡 Finding 8: Severity Level Inconsistency
**Severity:** 🟡 Medium
**Location:** `commands/audit.md:23` vs `rules/severity-framework.md`
**Evidence:** `audit.md` uses `🔵 Low` while `severity-framework.md` uses `🟢 Low`. Two different color schemes for the same severity level.
**Impact:** Minor confusion in audit reports.
**Recommendation:** Standardize all commands to use the severity-framework's official colors.

### 🟡 Finding 9: Newer Skills Are Much Deeper Than Older Ones
**Severity:** 🟡 Medium
**Location:** Tier 1 vs Tier 3 skills
**Evidence:** The newest skills (brutal-exhaustive-audit: 333 lines, product-completeness-audit: 328 lines, full-stack-api-integration: 297 lines) are 2x the size and depth of older audit skills (frontend-audit: 171 lines, observability-audit: 173 lines, dependency-audit: 151 lines).
**Impact:** Quality inconsistency across the library. Users may expect the same depth from all skills.
**Recommendation:** Incrementally enhance Tier 3 skills to approach Tier 1 depth, focusing on adding: anti-shortcut rules, rationalization prevention, and more concrete code examples.

### 🟡 Finding 10: Agent Files May Have Bash-Specific Commands
**Severity:** 🟡 Medium
**Location:** All 7 agent files
**Evidence:** Agent protocols include `npm run build 2>&1`, `grep -rn`, `cat .env`, `find .` — all bash commands.
**Impact:** Agents won't work correctly on Windows outside of a Linux sandbox.
**Recommendation:** Same as Finding 3 — document environment assumptions.

### 🟡 Finding 11: Some Skills Lack "When NOT to Use" Section
**Severity:** 🟡 Medium
**Location:** Multiple Tier 2 and Tier 3 skills
**Evidence:** The best skills (full-stack-api-integration, brutal-exhaustive-audit, product-completeness-audit) include a "When NOT to Use" section. Many others don't.
**Impact:** AI agents may over-apply skills in wrong contexts.
**Recommendation:** Add "When NOT to Use" sections to: `code-review`, `git-workflow`, `incident-response`, `writing-documentation`, `observability-audit`, `ci-cd-audit`, `accessibility-audit`.

### 🟡 Finding 12: `fix-issue` Command Is Too Thin
**Severity:** 🟡 Medium
**Location:** `commands/fix-issue.md` (1,222 B)
**Evidence:** Only 48 lines. Mostly a checklist reminder. No state tracking, no verification protocol, no integration with `.planning/`.
**Impact:** The command doesn't enforce the framework's own principles (evidence-based, plan-before-code).
**Recommendation:** Enhance to include: reading existing plans, state tracking, verification step with output capture.

### 🟡 Finding 13: Missing `_rules/SKILL.md` Bootstrap File
**Severity:** 🟡 Medium
**Location:** `skills/_rules/` (non-existent)
**Evidence:** GEMINI.md references this path. The installer likely should create it as a combined version of core-principles + anti-hallucination for agents that install skills to `.agent/skills/`.
**Impact:** Broken reference in GEMINI.md.
**Recommendation:** Create `skills/_rules/SKILL.md` that combines core-principles and anti-hallucination content, or update GEMINI.md to reference the correct files.

### 🟢 Finding 14: Cursor Rules Are Thin Versions
**Severity:** 🟢 Low
**Location:** All 10 `.mdc` files
**Evidence:** Cursor rules range from 1,440 B to 2,559 B — significantly thinner than the full skills (4,000-11,000 B).
**Impact:** Cursor users get a compressed experience compared to Claude Code or Gemini users.
**Recommendation:** Accepted trade-off. Cursor rules are constrained by format. Could add links to full skills.

### 🟢 Finding 15: No Skill for "Estimation" or "Effort Assessment"
**Severity:** 🟢 Low
**Location:** N/A
**Evidence:** Skills reference "Estimated Effort: S/M/L" but there's no skill for how to estimate.
**Impact:** Agents guess at effort estimates without guidance.
**Recommendation:** Consider a lightweight `estimation` skill or add estimation guidance to `writing-plans`.

### 🟢 Finding 16: No Changelog for Skill Updates
**Severity:** 🟢 Low
**Location:** Project-wide
**Evidence:** No CHANGELOG.md or version tracking for individual skills.
**Impact:** Hard to know when a skill was last updated or what changed.
**Recommendation:** Consider adding a `last_updated` field to SKILL.md frontmatter.

### 🟢 Finding 17: `writing-skills` Could Reference Its Own Standards
**Severity:** 🟢 Low
**Location:** `skills/writing-skills/SKILL.md:128`
**Evidence:** The "What Makes a Skill Valuable" table is an excellent rubric but doesn't reference specific examples from the library.
**Impact:** Skill authors don't have concrete models to follow.
**Recommendation:** Add a "Reference Skills" section pointing to 2-3 flagship skills as gold standards.

### 🟢 Finding 18: Some Commands Missing `allowed-tools` Frontmatter
**Severity:** 🟢 Low
**Location:** `commands/audit.md`, `commands/debug.md`, `commands/fix-issue.md`, and others
**Evidence:** Some commands have `allowed-tools` in frontmatter, others don't.
**Impact:** Inconsistent tool access for Claude Code subagents.
**Recommendation:** Add `allowed-tools` to all commands that need them.

### 🟢 Finding 19: `doc.md` and `explain.md` Are Nearly Identical in Scope
**Severity:** 🟢 Low
**Location:** `commands/doc.md` (1,506 B), `commands/explain.md` (1,477 B)
**Evidence:** Both explain code, one generates documentation. Overlap.
**Impact:** Minor user confusion.
**Recommendation:** Consider merging into a single `explain` command with `--doc` flag, or better differentiate their purposes.

### ⚪ Info 1: Skill Count Has Outgrown Entry Point Documentation
**Evidence:** 29 skills, but CLAUDE.md lists 22 in file structure. Natural growth, needs periodic sync.

### ⚪ Info 2: The Quality Gap Between Generations is Expected
**Evidence:** v1 skills (frontend-audit, observability-audit) were written before patterns like "Iron Questions" and "Anti-Shortcut Rules" were established. The newer skills incorporate lessons learned.

### ⚪ Info 3: Agents Are Claude Code-Specific
**Evidence:** Agent files use Claude Code's subagent spawning model. This is by design — other agents use the skills directly.

## Verdict: 🟡 CONDITIONAL PASS

ALENA is structurally strong. The strongest skills — `brutal-exhaustive-audit`, `product-completeness-audit`, and `full-stack-api-integration` — set a high bar, and the rules layer plus agent definitions give the toolkit solid operational discipline.

However, the **entry points are stale** (CLAUDE.md and GEMINI.md don't reflect the full library), and there's a **quality gap between generations** of skills that needs addressing. The critical fixes (updating activation tables and fixing broken references) should be done immediately.

**Bottom line:** The framework is 80% excellent and 20% needs love. The 20% is mostly bookkeeping and consistency, not fundamental quality issues.
