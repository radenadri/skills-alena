# 📦 Asset Types

> Understanding the ALENA asset surfaces and where they fit

ALENA ships 10 primary asset types. Some are directly installed into agent directories, while others support planning, coordination, and runtime behavior behind the scenes.

## 🧠 Skills

**What:** Deep instructional documents that teach AI agents HOW to approach engineering tasks.

**Format:** Each skill is a folder with a `SKILL.md` file:
```
skills/
└── code-review/
    └── SKILL.md     # 200+ lines of protocols, examples, anti-patterns
```

**Install Location:** Agent's skills directory (e.g., `.claude/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`, `.agent/skills/`)

**How Agents Use Them:** The agent reads the SKILL.md when you ask it to use a specific skill. The skill teaches the agent a structured approach with principles, protocols, and quality criteria.

---

## ⚡ Commands

**What:** Claude Code slash commands — structured markdown files that Claude Code invokes when you type `/command-name`.

**Format:** Single `.md` file per command:
```
commands/
├── plan.md
├── execute.md
├── review.md
└── memory.md
```

**Install Location:** `.claude/commands/`

**How They Work:** In Claude Code, type `/plan` and it reads `commands/plan.md` as a structured protocol, then follows the instructions.

---

## 🔄 Workflows

**What:** Antigravity step-by-step execution scripts — numbered steps that Antigravity follows sequentially.

**Format:** Single `.md` file per workflow with YAML frontmatter:
```yaml
---
description: Execute plans with wave-based steps and verification
---
### Step 1: Read the plan
// turbo
Read .planning/PLAN.md...
```

**Install Location:** `.agent/workflows/`

**How They Work:** In Antigravity, use `/workflow-name` to activate. Steps marked `// turbo` auto-execute without user approval.

---

## 🤖 Agents

**What:** Specialist AI personas for Claude Code's agent system — detailed role definitions with protocols and anti-patterns.

**Format:** Single `.md` file per agent:
```
agents/
├── researcher.md
├── planner.md
├── executor.md
├── reviewer.md
├── debugger.md
├── verifier.md
└── mapper.md
```

**Install Location:** `.claude/agents/`

**How They Work:** Claude Code can spawn these as specialist sub-agents for specific tasks. Each agent file defines the agent's role, focus areas, principles, and output format.

---

## 🎯 Cursor Rules

**What:** `.mdc` rule files that guide Cursor AI's behavior — automatically applied based on glob patterns.

**Format:** `.mdc` file with frontmatter:
```markdown
---
description: Security best practices
globs: *
---
# Instructions for the AI
...
```

**Install Location:** `.cursor/rules/`

**How They Work:** Cursor automatically loads rules matching the current file's glob pattern. Rules with `globs: *` are always active.

---

## 📏 Rules

**What:** Universal markdown rules that can be pasted into any agent's configuration file.

**Format:** Single `.md` file:
```
rules/
├── core-principles.md
├── anti-hallucination.md
├── severity-framework.md
├── memory-protocol.md
└── team-protocol.md
```

**Install Location:** Appended to `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, or any agent config.

**How They Work:** The content is added to the agent's persistent system prompt, so it's always active for every conversation.

---

## 🔗 Hooks

**What:** Production lifecycle hooks for Claude Code's hook system — automatically triggered at specific runtime events.

**Format:** `.js` scripts or `.md` prompt hooks:
```
hooks/
├── security-gate.js          # PostToolUse — scans for secrets and injection
├── statusline.js             # PreInputSanitization — model + context % display
├── context-monitor.js        # PostToolUse — warns at 65%/75% context usage
├── update-check.js           # SessionStart — checks npm for newer version
├── memory-capture.md         # PreCompact — captures weighted memories
├── hook-profiles.js          # Library — three-tier hook gating (minimal/standard/strict)
├── suggest-compact.js        # PostToolUse — strategic compaction suggestions
└── cost-tracker.js           # PostToolUse + Stop — session metrics tracking
```

**Install Location:** Registered in Claude Code's `settings.json` hooks array

**How They Work:** Automatically registered during installation. Script hooks read JSON from stdin and output JSON to stdout with a 3-second timeout. Prompt hooks use `type: "prompt"` and run as inline prompts. All hooks silent-fail on errors to never block the user.

See [Hooks Reference](Hooks-Reference.md) for full details.

---

## 📝 Templates

**What:** Structured markdown templates for plans, handoffs, decisions, context documents, and other planning artifacts.

**Format:** `.md` template files with placeholder sections:
```
templates/
├── plan.md                   # PLAN.md structure with <files>, <action>, <verify>, <done>
├── context.md                # CONTEXT.md for locked decisions from /discuss
├── handoff.md                # Session handoff document
├── decision.md               # Decision record template
└── ... (11 total)
```

**Install Location:** Used by commands and workflows internally — not installed to a user-visible directory

**How They Work:** Commands like `/plan`, `/discuss`, and `/execute` use these templates to generate structured output. Templates enforce consistent document structure across all planning artifacts.

---

## 📚 References

**What:** Reference documents that provide lookup tables and decision frameworks used by skills and commands.

**Format:** `.md` reference files:
```
references/
├── questioning.md            # MCQ questioning framework for /discuss
└── deviation-rules.md        # Deviation classification and escalation rules
```

**How They Work:** Skills and commands reference these documents when they need structured decision criteria (e.g., how to classify a deviation, how to structure MCQ questions).

---

## ⚙️ CLI Modules

**What:** Deterministic state management commands that handle operations LLMs are unreliable at — JSON updates, counter tracking, file creation.

**Format:** Sub-commands of `planning-tools.cjs`:
```
13 module surfaces: the `planning-tools.cjs` entrypoint plus the support modules that power init, state, config, progress, council routing, gates, handoffs, board updates, messaging, and review flows
```

**Install Location:** Project root (via `planning-tools.cjs`)

**How They Work:** The AI calls these commands during execution (e.g., `node planning-tools.cjs state advance-task`). They handle structured data operations deterministically — no LLM hallucination risk for state management.

See [Council System](Council-System.md) for the council flow and [Commands Reference](Commands-Reference.md) for the user-facing command layer.
