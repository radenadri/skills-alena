# ⚡ Commands Reference

> 34 Claude Code slash commands for the complete project lifecycle

Commands are `.md` files installed to `.claude/commands/`. They provide structured protocols that Claude Code invokes when you type the slash command.

---

## 🏗️ Project Lifecycle

### `/init-project`
**Initialize a new project with standard structure.**

Creates the `.planning/` directory with:
- `PROJECT.md` — Project definition (name, tech stack, objectives)
- `REQUIREMENTS.md` — Functional and non-functional requirements
- `ROADMAP.md` — Phase-ordered implementation roadmap
- `STATE.md` — Current project state and progress tracker
- `config.json` — Project configuration

**Usage:**
```
/init-project Create a REST API for user management with Node.js and PostgreSQL
```

### `/plan`
**Create a detailed implementation plan.**

Generates `.planning/PLAN.md` with:
- Task decomposition with dependencies
- Effort estimates (S/M/L/XL)
- Execution waves (dependency-ordered)
- Risk register
- Acceptance criteria per task

### `/execute`
**Execute an implementation plan.**

Reads the plan and implements tasks wave by wave:
- Respects dependency order
- Creates checkpoints between waves
- Runs inline verification after each task
- Updates progress state
- Stops on blockers

### `/verify`
**Validate implementation against the plan.**

Multi-layer verification:
1. Automated checks (tests, linting, types)
2. Compliance validation against acceptance criteria
3. Regression testing
4. Edge case exploration
5. Conversational UAT (walks through findings with you)

### `/progress`
**Show project status and task completion.**

Displays:
- Phase completion status
- Task completion percentages
- Active tasks and blockers
- Timeline and milestones

---

## 🔬 Research & Documentation

### `/research`
**Deep research before planning.**

Generates structured reports in `.planning/research/`:
- Topic exploration with source citations
- Codebase analysis with evidence
- Alternative approaches with trade-offs
- Recommendation with rationale

### `/doc`
**Generate documentation.**

Creates or updates documentation for:
- Code (inline comments, JSDoc, docstrings)
- APIs (OpenAPI, endpoint docs)
- Architecture (decision records, diagrams)
- Setup (dev environment, deployment)

### `/explain`
**Explain code, architecture, or concepts.**

Provides detailed explanations at multiple levels:
- High-level overview (what and why)
- Implementation details (how)
- Trade-offs and alternatives
- Visual diagrams when helpful

### `/learn`
**Extract reusable patterns and learnings from current session.**

Captures session knowledge for future reuse:
- Identifies patterns, decisions, and solutions discovered during the session
- Writes learnings to persistent memory
- Tags learnings by category (architecture, debugging, performance, etc.)

---

## 🔧 Code Quality

### `/quality-gate`
**Run technical quality checks before commits/PRs.**

Runs build, lint, test, and security checks in sequence:
| Mode | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `quick` | Fast checks only (lint + type-check) |
| `full` | All checks including tests and security scan |
| `pre-commit` | Checks appropriate for a commit |
| `pre-pr` | Full checks required before opening a PR |

**Usage:**
```
/quality-gate quick

```

### `/review`
**Structured code review with severity feedback.**

Reviews recent changes or specified files:
- 🔴 Critical (blocks ship)
- 🟡 Major (should fix)
- 🔵 Minor (consider fixing)
- ⚪ Nit (optional cleanup)

### `/test`
**Generate and run tests.**

Creates tests following TDD patterns:
- Unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests for module interactions
- E2e tests for user flows
- Coverage reports

### `/debug`
**Scientific debugging with hypothesis tracking.**

Follows the systematic debugging protocol:
1. Reproduce → 2. Hypothesize → 3. Test → 4. Narrow → 5. Fix → 6. Verify

### `/fix-issue`
**Diagnose and fix a specific issue.**

Minimal, focused fix:
- Identify root cause
- Apply smallest possible change
- Add regression test
- Verify no side effects

### `/refactor`
**Safe, incremental refactoring.**

Restructures code without changing behavior:
- Ensures test coverage first
- Atomic commits per refactoring step
- Verifies behavior after each change

---

## ⚙️ Operations & Security

- Secrets detection in code
- Dependency vulnerability scan
- Auth/authz flow review
- Input validation audit
- Severity-based reporting

### `/deploy-check`
**Pre-deployment validation.**

Runs through deployment checklist:
- All tests pass
- No security vulnerabilities
- Environment variables configured
- Database migrations ready
- Rollback plan documented

### `/audit`
**Full codebase audit.**

Comprehensive sweep:
- Code quality (linting, formatting)
- Secrets in code (API keys, passwords)
- Console logs in production code
- TODO/FIXME/HACK comments
- Dead code and unused imports

---

## 🔄 Workflow

### `/quick`
**Execute small tasks without full planning.**

For well-defined, small tasks that don't need a formal plan:
- Make a quick change
- Fix a typo
- Update a config value
- Add a simple feature

### `/checkpoint`
**Create or verify named progress checkpoints.**

Modes:
| Mode | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `create` | Save a named checkpoint of current progress |
| `verify` | Verify a checkpoint is still valid |
| `list` | List all checkpoints in the current session |

**Usage:**
```
/checkpoint create "auth module complete"
/checkpoint verify "auth module complete"
/checkpoint list
```

### `/loop`
**Run repetitive tasks across multiple targets with safety bounds.**

Executes the same operation across multiple files, modules, or targets:
- Automatic safety limits to prevent runaway execution
- Parallel execution support for independent targets
- Progress tracking and failure reporting

**Flags:**
| Flag | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `--limit N` | Maximum number of iterations (safety bound) |
| `--parallel` | Run iterations in parallel where safe |

**Usage:**
```
/loop --limit 10 "add error handling to each controller"
/loop --parallel --limit 5 "update imports in each module"
```

### `/commit`
**Create well-formatted Git commits.**

Generates Conventional Commits:
```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 token refresh

**Presets (6):**
| Preset | Agents | Use Case |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `full` | researcher → architect → planner → executor → reviewer | Complex features |
| `rapid` | researcher → executor → reviewer | Quick implementations |
| `debug` | investigator → fixer → verifier | Bug fixes |
| `architecture` | researcher → architect → reviewer | Design decisions |
| `refactoring` | researcher → planner → executor → reviewer | Code restructuring |
| `audit` | researcher → mapper → reviewer | Codebase analysis |

**Usage:**
```
/team start "implement user auth" --preset full
```

See [Council System](Council-System.md) for the full architecture and CLI command reference.
