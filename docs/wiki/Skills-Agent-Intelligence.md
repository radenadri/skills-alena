> 2 skills that give AI agents persistent memory and team coordination capabilities

These skills are core to **ALENA v1.0.0**. They give the toolkit its two biggest coordination advantages: memory that survives across sessions and a structured way to split difficult work across specialist agents.

## 23. 💾 persistent-memory

**Use When:** Any project where you work across multiple AI sessions and need context to persist.

**What It Does:**
Creates a file-based memory system in `.planning/` that automatically captures and retrieves context across sessions. No databases, no hooks, no external services — just markdown files.

**The Problem It Solves:**
Every AI session starts from scratch. You explain the same architecture, repeat the same decisions, and lose the context you built in previous sessions.

**How It Works:**

```
SESSION START                    DURING SESSION                 SESSION END
┌──────────────┐                ┌──────────────┐               ┌──────────────┐
│Read MEMORY.md│                │Capture:      │               │Write session │
│Read LATEST.md│───►            │ ▪ Decisions  │───►           │Write handoff │
│Full context! │                │ ▪ Gotchas    │               │Update memory │
└──────────────┘                │ ▪ Architecture│              │Compress      │
                                └──────────────┘               └──────────────┘
```

**Memory Directory Structure:**
```
.planning/
├── MEMORY.md                    # 🧠 Project brain (~300 lines max)
├── sessions/
│   ├── 2026-02-08-session-1.md  # Session log
│   └── _archive/                # Compressed old sessions
├── decisions/
│   └── DECISIONS.md             # Chronological decision log
├── context/
│   ├── architecture.md          # Architecture decisions
│   ├── patterns.md              # Code patterns
│   ├── gotchas.md               # Known issues
│   └── tech-debt.md             # Technical debt
└── handoffs/
    └── LATEST.md                # Last session's handoff
```

**Token Budget:**
| File | Lines | Tokens | When Loaded |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---|
| MEMORY.md | ~300 | ~1,500 | Always (session start) |
| LATEST.md | ~30 | ~150 | Always (session start) |
| Context files | Varies | Varies | On demand |
| Session logs | Varies | Varies | Never (unless asked) |
| **Total auto** | **~330** | **~1,650** | **Per session** |

**Compression Protocol:**
When MEMORY.md exceeds 300 lines:
1. Recent sessions → keep last 5
2. Key decisions → keep last 10
3. Resolved issues → remove
4. Detailed content → move to `context/` files
5. Old session logs → move to `sessions/_archive/`

**Setup Per Agent:**
| Agent | How to Enable |
|:---|:---|
| 🟢 Antigravity | Add memory instructions to `GEMINI.md` |
| 🔵 Cursor | Install `memory-protocol.mdc` rule |
| 🟣 Claude Code | Use `/memory init` command |

**Why ALENA keeps this lightweight:**
| Feature | Heavier memory stacks | `persistent-memory` |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| Infrastructure | SQLite + Chroma + Bun | Zero ✅ |
| Agent support | Claude Code only | ANY agent ✅ |
| Setup complexity | Plugin + worker service | 4 lines in GEMINI.md ✅ |
| Version control | Not git-native | Git-native ✅ |
| Token cost | Variable (progressive) | ~1,650 flat ✅ |

## 24. 💎 agent-team-coordination

**Use When:** Complex tasks that benefit from deep project knowledge and structured specialist coordination — research, design, plan, execute, review.

**What It Does:**
Implements the ALENA team-coordination pattern: an orchestrator agent spawns real subagents via `Task()`, each getting a fresh context window. Instead of forcing one agent to carry the whole problem, ALENA uses file-based handoffs, explicit role boundaries, and deterministic council state management.

**The Problem It Solves:**
AI coding tasks degrade when one agent tries to own research, planning, execution, and review in a single context window. Linear handoffs also lose detail. ALENA solves that with explicit specialist turns, shared project memory, and quality gates between stages.

**How It Works:**
