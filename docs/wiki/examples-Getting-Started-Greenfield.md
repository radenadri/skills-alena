# Example: Greenfield Walkthrough

> Building a real-time trading dashboard from scratch — full conversation flow showing every step.

---

## The Scenario

You're building a **real-time trading dashboard** that shows live crypto prices, your portfolio, and trade history. No code exists yet.

---

## Step 0: Clarify the Product

**You:**
```
/prd "I want a personal crypto trading dashboard but I need help defining the product clearly first"
```

**AI responds:**
```
Before we talk implementation, I'll clarify the product shape.

1. Who is the primary user?
2. What are the core jobs this dashboard must do?
3. What is explicitly out of scope for v1?
4. What constraints matter most: time, budget, external APIs, complexity?
5. How will you know v1 is successful?
```

**You:**
```
1. Just me — personal use
2. Live prices, portfolio visibility, trade history, P&L charts
3. No automated trading in v1
4. Must connect to Binance API. 1 week timeline.
5. I can monitor positions and review recent trading performance in one place.
```

**AI produces:**
- a PRD with goals, non-goals, constraints, and success metrics
- a clearer project boundary before planning starts

---

## Step 1: Install and Init

**You:** Install skills and tell your AI agent:
```
/init-project
```

**AI responds:**
```
I'll set up the project structure. Let me bootstrap the planning system first.

> Running: node planning-tools.cjs init

✅ Created .planning/ directory with 12 files:
  - MEMORY.md, STATE.md, config.json
  - decisions/, plans/, research/, sessions/, handoffs/
  - context/architecture.md, patterns.md, gotchas.md, tech-debt.md

Now I need to understand what we're building. Let me ask some questions:

1. What is this project?
2. Who is it for?
3. What are the main features?
4. What tech stack do you prefer?
5. Any hard constraints (timeline, budget, existing integrations)?
```

**You:**
```
1. Real-time trading dashboard for crypto
2. Just me — personal use
3. Live prices, portfolio view, trade history, P&L charts
4. Next.js, Supabase, TailwindCSS
5. Must connect to Binance API. 1 week timeline.
```

**AI writes:**
- `MEMORY.md` — project brain with all context
- `ROADMAP.md` — phases (Data Pipeline → Charts → Portfolio → Alerts)
- `REQUIREMENTS.md` — feature list with priorities

---

## Step 2: Discuss the First Feature

**You:**
```
/discuss implement live price feed
```

**AI responds:**

```markdown
## 📋 Discussion: Live Price Feed

I've identified 4 decisions we need to lock before planning.

---

### Q1: Data Connection 📡

| | Option | What It Means |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| **A** | WebSocket (real-time) | Sub-second updates, more complex, persistent connection |
| **B** | REST polling (every 5s) | Simple, uses more bandwidth, slight delay |
| **C** | ✏️ Custom | Describe your preference |

> 🏆 **Recommended: A** — You said "real-time" so WebSocket is the right fit

---

### Q2: Price Display Format 💰

| | Option | What It Means |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| **A** | Table with sparklines | Dense info, classic trading UI |
| **B** | Cards with mini-charts | Visual, modern, less data density |
| **C** | ✏️ Custom | Describe your preference |

> 🏆 **Recommended: A** — Matches professional trading dashboards

---

### Q3: Number of Trading Pairs 📊

| | Option | What It Means |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| **A** | Top 10 (BTC, ETH, ...) | Fast, focused, low bandwidth |
| **B** | Top 50 | Comprehensive, more WebSocket streams |
| **C** | User-configurable watchlist | Most flexible, more UI work |
| **D** | ✏️ Custom | Describe your preference |

> 🏆 **Recommended: C** — You'll want to customize this over time

---

### Q4: State Management 🗄️

| | Option | What It Means |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| **A** | React state (useState) | Simple, no extra deps, might re-render a lot |
| **B** | Zustand | Lightweight, good perf with selectors |
| **C** | Redux Toolkit | Heavy but battle-tested for complex state |
| **D** | ✏️ Custom | Describe your preference |

> 🏆 **Recommended: B** — Perfect balance for real-time data with minimal re-renders

---

### ⚡ Quick Answer

> **All recommended:** `1A 2A 3C 4B`
>
> **Example custom:** `1A 2B 3C 4:"use Jotai instead"`

**Your answer:**
```

**You respond:**
```
1A 2A 3C 4B
```

**AI confirms and locks:**
```markdown
## ✅ Decisions Locked

| # | Decision | Your Choice | Notes |
|---|----------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | Data connection | A: WebSocket | 🏆 Matches recommendation |
| 2 | Display format | A: Table + sparklines | 🏆 Matches recommendation |
| 3 | Trading pairs | C: User watchlist | 🏆 Matches recommendation |
| 4 | State management | B: Zustand | 🏆 Matches recommendation |

Saved to: .planning/research/live-price-feed-context.md
Recorded: "Discussed live-price-feed — locked 4 decisions"

Confirm these are correct? Then I'll create the plan.
```

---

## Step 3: Plan

**You:**
```
/plan
```

**AI creates** `.planning/plans/001-live-price-feed.md`:

```markdown
## Plan: Live Price Feed

### Task 1: WebSocket Service + Zustand Store

<files>
- src/services/binance-ws.ts (CREATE)
- src/stores/price-store.ts (CREATE)
- src/types/trading.ts (CREATE)
</files>

<action>
Create a Binance WebSocket service that connects to the spot market stream.
Use Zustand for state (locked decision Q4=B).
DON'T use REST polling — we're using WebSocket (locked decision Q1=A).
DON'T hardcode trading pairs — make it configurable (locked decision Q3=C).
</action>

<verify>
Run: npx tsc --noEmit
Check: WebSocket connects and receives price updates in dev console
</verify>

<done>
- [ ] WebSocket service connects to Binance
- [ ] Zustand store holds prices keyed by symbol
- [ ] TypeScript types defined for Price, Ticker, WatchlistItem
</done>

### Task 2: Price Table UI with Sparklines

<files>
- src/components/PriceTable.tsx (CREATE)
- src/components/Sparkline.tsx (CREATE)
- src/components/WatchlistManager.tsx (CREATE)
- src/app/page.tsx (EDIT)
</files>

<action>
Build a table component that displays real-time prices from the Zustand store.
Use table format with sparklines (locked decision Q2=A).
Include a watchlist manager for adding/removing pairs.
</action>

<verify>
Run: npm run build
Visual: Table shows live-updating prices with sparkline charts
</verify>

<done>
- [ ] PriceTable renders all watchlist items
- [ ] Sparkline shows 1-minute candle history
- [ ] WatchlistManager lets user add/remove pairs
- [ ] Prices update in real-time without full table re-render
</done>
```

---

## Step 4: Execute

**You:**
```
/execute
```

**AI works through tasks:**

```
📋 Loading plan: .planning/plans/001-live-price-feed.md
📍 State: Phase 0, Plan 0, Task 0

--- Task 1: WebSocket Service + Zustand Store ---

Creating src/services/binance-ws.ts...
Creating src/stores/price-store.ts...
Creating src/types/trading.ts...

Running verification: npx tsc --noEmit ✅
Testing WebSocket connection... ✅ Receiving BTC/USDT prices

✅ Task 1 complete.
> Running: node planning-tools.cjs state advance-task
> Committing: git commit -m "feat(prices): add Binance WebSocket service and Zustand price store"

--- Task 2: Price Table UI with Sparklines ---

Creating src/components/PriceTable.tsx...
Creating src/components/Sparkline.tsx...
Creating src/components/WatchlistManager.tsx...
Editing src/app/page.tsx...

Running verification: npm run build ✅
Visual check: Table rendering with live data ✅

✅ Task 2 complete.
> Running: node planning-tools.cjs state advance-task
> Committing: git commit -m "feat(ui): add real-time price table with sparklines and watchlist"

📊 Plan complete. 2/2 tasks done.
```

---

## Step 5: Verify

**You:**
```
/verify
```

**AI validates:**

```
✅ All planned files exist (6/6)
✅ Build passes (npm run build)
✅ TypeScript clean (npx tsc --noEmit)
✅ WebSocket connects and receives data
✅ Table renders with live prices
✅ Sparklines animate correctly
✅ Watchlist add/remove works

Result: PASS — all verification checks passed.
No gaps detected.
```
