# Verification Before Completion

## Overview

Claiming work is complete without verification is dishonesty, not efficiency.

**Core principle:** Evidence before claims, always.

**Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit of this rule.**

## The Iron Law

```
NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
```

If you haven't run the verification command *in this response*, you cannot claim it passes.

## When to Use

**Always — before ANY of these claims:**
- "Tests pass"
- "Build succeeds"
- "Bug is fixed"
- "Feature is complete"
- "Linter is clean"
- "Type-safe"
- "No regressions"
- "It works"
- "Done"

## When NOT to Use

This skill has no exceptions. If you're about to claim something is done, use this skill.

## Anti-Shortcut Rules

```
YOU CANNOT:
- Say "should work" — run it and show the output
- Say "tests pass" without test output in this response — stale evidence is not evidence
- Say "build succeeds" because "linter passed" — they're different things
- Trust a sub-agent's success claim — verify independently
- Use "looks good" as verification — what command proves it?
- Claim "done" based on mental reasoning — evidence is output, not thought
- Skip full test suite because "only this file changed" — regressions are unexpected
- Express satisfaction ("Great!", "Perfect!") before verification — verify, then celebrate
```

## Common Rationalizations (Don't Accept These)

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Should work now" | RUN the verification |
| "I'm confident" | Confidence ≠ evidence |
| "Just this once" | No exceptions |
| "Linter passed" | Linter ≠ compiler ≠ tests |
| "Agent said success" | Verify independently |
| "I'm tired" | Exhaustion ≠ excuse |
| "Partial check is enough" | Partial proves nothing |
| "Different words, so rule doesn't apply" | Spirit over letter |
| "I checked mentally" | Mental checks aren't evidence |
| "It's a trivial change" | Trivial changes cause most outages |

## Iron Questions

```
1. What COMMAND proves this claim? (name the exact command)
2. Have I run that command in THIS response? (not earlier, not "just now")
3. Does the output ACTUALLY confirm the claim? (read the output — don't skim)
4. Did I check the EXIT CODE? (0 = success, not always)
5. Are there any WARNINGS I'm ignoring? (warnings often become errors)
6. Did I run the FULL relevant suite? (not just one test)
7. Am I claiming more than the evidence shows? ("tests pass" vs "these 3 tests pass")
8. Would I bet money on this claim based on this evidence? (if not, gather more)
```

## The Gate Function

```
BEFORE claiming any status or expressing satisfaction:

1. IDENTIFY: What command proves this claim?
2. RUN: Execute the FULL command (fresh, complete)
3. READ: Full output — check exit code, count failures
4. VERIFY: Does output actually confirm the claim?
   - If NO → State actual status with evidence
   - If YES → State claim WITH evidence
5. ONLY THEN: Make the claim

Skip any step = lying, not verifying.
```

## Verification Requirements

| Claim | Requires | Not Sufficient |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| "Tests pass" | Test output: 0 failures, all pass | Previous run, "should pass" |
| "Build succeeds" | Build output: exit 0 | "Linter passed" |
| "Linter clean" | Linter output: 0 errors, 0 warnings | Partial check |
| "Bug fixed" | Reproduction test passes + no regressions | "Code changed" |
| "Type-safe" | Type checker output: 0 errors | "No red squiggles" |
| "Feature complete" | Line-by-line requirement check + all tests | "Tests pass" |
| "No regressions" | Full suite green | Targeted tests only |
| "Agent completed" | VCS diff of actual changes | Agent's "success" claim |
| "Deployed" | Health check returns 200 + metrics stable | Deploy command exit 0 |
| "Performance improved" | Before/after benchmarks | "Feels faster" |
| "Security fixed" | Vulnerability scan passes | "Patched the code" |

## Patterns

### Tests
```
✅ [Run test command] → [Output shows: 34/34 pass] → "All 34 tests pass"
❌ "Should pass now"
❌ "Tests look correct"
```

### Regression Test (TDD Red-Green)
```
✅ Write test → Run (FAIL) → Fix → Run (PASS) → Revert fix → Run (FAIL) → Restore → Run (PASS)
❌ "I wrote a regression test" (without red-green cycle)
```

### Build
```
✅ [Run build] → [Output shows: exit 0, no errors] → "Build passes"
❌ "Linter passed, so build should be fine"
```

### Requirements
```
✅ Re-read plan → Create checklist → Verify each item with evidence → Report gaps or completion
❌ "Tests pass, so feature is complete"
```

### Deployment
```
✅ Deploy → Health check → Metrics stable for 15min → Error rate baseline →  "Deployed successfully"
❌ "Deploy command succeeded"
```

## Red Flags — STOP

You are about to violate this rule if:

- Using "should", "probably", "seems to", "looks like"
- Expressing satisfaction before verification ("Great!", "Perfect!", "Done!")
- About to commit/push/PR without running tests
- Trusting a subagent's success report without checking
- Relying on partial verification ("well, this test passes...")
- Thinking "just this once"
- Tired and wanting to be done
- **ANY wording implying success without having run verification**

## Integration

- **Used after:** Every `executing-plans` task
- **Used after:** Every `systematic-debugging` fix
- **Used before:** Every `git-workflow` merge
- **Enables:** Honest `code-review` findings
- **Prevents:** False "done" claims in `incident-response`
